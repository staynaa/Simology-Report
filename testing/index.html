        <p class="about">To make Create-A-Sim feel less like a requirement to play and more like a reason to, 
            Simology Report provides well curated results based on answers chosen within our detailed questionaire.
        </p>
        <p class="about">Like the in game story builder created by The Sims 4 developers, Simology Report reviews your answers and 
            provides you with an aspiration, three traits, a job, five likes and five dislikes, a fashion style aesthetic 
            to base your sim's outfits on, and randomized information that are not based on the questionaire, but rather to 
            give players a complete blueprint to complete their sim.
