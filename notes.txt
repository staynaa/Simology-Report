Grabbing some lunch
Day nap
Quick work out

A robot butler would be very helpful

A action comedy
A sad drama
A romantic movie
A sing-a-long musical

  At an art museum, you… 
Feel inspired. Someone get me a paint brush and easel immediately! 
Feel bored, more of a science person.
Start to think that these pieces must be worth a fortune… (kleptomaniac)
Wish to collect all these pieces one day.

 Which best describes you?
Life of the party
Perfection at its finest
No mountain is ever too high 
If i want it, i get it

 Where are you at the party?
By the piano, playing renditions of the classics
By the bar, serving up drinks
Chatting with the party
Taking pictures all night

 Someone just pulled a crazy prank on you…
I HATE PRANKS
I’ll prank them right back
Laugh it out, no harm was done
